#### The Best TripAdvisor Game You've Ever Played

Of over forty teams competing in the Washington University Hackathon, we placed within the top five and received Honorable Mention. We utilized the TripAdvisor API in order to make an international location trivia game. Similar to “Trivia Crack”, players were prompted with a randomized review on TripAdvisor from somewhere around the globe, and players had to guess from one of four locations what city the review was relevant to. We built a responsive web application, as well as a native iOS and Android application.
