I stayed for 3 nights. The club rooms were on higher floors and the view of the Shwedagon Pagoda from the corner room was fantastic. The bathroom and its amenities were good. I was told by regular guests that while under renovation the club lounge was moved to a smaller room without views. Happy hour was quite satisfying with good food and socializing....

Although my friend and I did not stay here we went for the cocktails and to use wifi as this hotel is AMAZING for both. Friendly staff are very attentive but also leave you to it to surf the net and prices for cocktails are very reasonable.
Great location and highly recommended as a place to meet people, connect with the world and have a break from the busy ness and heat of Yangon...

Spend 4 days in the Traders hotel in Yangon and I must commend the team for ensuring a great stay. The service was excellent and better than I have experienced in many other 5 star hotels in Asia. Apart from the great service, their unique selling point is their location and of course they have got the best WIFI in town (a significant advantage with the limited internet access available in Yangon).
